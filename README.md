Key features of the OIPT-RecipeViewer:
The OIPT-RecipeViewer was written to enable the following workflows:

Quickly get an overview of an entire recipe before starting e.g. a deposition run.
Visualize the variation of process parameters as a function of process steps.
Error detection in recipes, highlighting steps that fail to comply.
Reliable time-to-completion calculation.
The following features are especially useful for sharing and documenting of recipes:

Save recipes as “oipt” files facilitating easy sharing of recipe-intent between users.
Export recipes to Excel format for use in e.g. a presentation or document.
Highlight / find differences between recipes useful for e.g. standardization on a known-good recipe.
You can zip the entire Recdata folder on a Oxford Tool, move this zip file to e.g. an USB stick and open it from the comfort of your desk.
